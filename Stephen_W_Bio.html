				<p
					>Stephen Wolfram (born 29 August 1959) is a British-American
					computer scientist, physicist, and businessman. He is known for
					his work in computer science, mathematics, and theoretical
					physics. In 2012, he was named a fellow of the American
					Mathematical Society. As a businessman, he is the founder and CEO
					of the software company Wolfram Research where he works as chief
					designer of Mathematica and the Wolfram Alpha answer engine.

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p
					>Wolfram was educated at Eton College, but left prematurely in
					1976. As a young child, Wolfram had difficulties learning
					arithmetic. He entered St. John's College, Oxford, at age 17 and
					left in 1978 without graduating to attend the California
					Institute of Technology the following year, where he received a
					PhD in particle physics in 1980. Wolfram's thesis committee was
					composed of Richard Feynman, Peter Goldreich, Frank J. Sciulli
					and Steven Frautschi, and chaired by Richard D. Field</p

				<h2>Early career</h2>
				<p
					>Wolfram, at the age of 15, began research in applied quantum
					field theory and particle physics and published scientific papers
					in peer-reviewed scientific journals including Nuclear Physics B,
					Australian Journal of Physics, Nuovo Cimento, and Physical Review
					D. Working independently, Wolfram published a widely cited paper
					on heavy quark production at age 18 and nine other
					papers.Wolfram's work with Geoffrey C. Fox on the theory of the
					strong interaction is still used in experimental particle
					physics. Following his PhD, Wolfram joined the faculty at Caltech
					and became the youngest recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship in
					1981, at age 21.
